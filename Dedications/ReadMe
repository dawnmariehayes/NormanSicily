# Dedications
What we can also do with this data is separate it depending on different attributes. For example, we can create heat maps which can show which areas have higher seismic classification values or we can also calculate which areas had more dedications than other areas. With the code, we are able to create choropleth maps on the province level. Using GIS, we are able to separate the data in commune level. The problem with separating the maps using commune level is that it does become messy since there is more separation which occurs. It is more accurate to separate different attributes depending on the commune level but it is not as visually appealing as separating it by the province level. 
The first map begins to show you where all of the monasteries in Sicily are located. 
 

	Dedications will be grouped as the following: 
•	Group 1: Christ
•	Group 2: All Saints
•	Group 3: The Holy dedications
•	Group 4: The Virgin Mary
 
After putting all four groups on the map, now we need to separate to see if there is any geographical clustering across the four dedications. 
 
	When separating the 4 groups into different points, you mainly see 3 colors. Each color is associated with a different type of dedication.
•	Orange= The Virgin Mary
•	Green= The Holy Dedication
•	Purple= All Saints
•	White= Christ
The purple does not show due to the fact that there is only one monastery that is dedicated to all the saints and it is surrounded by other monasteries which makes it a little hidden. 
 
The one monastery dedicated to all saints is located in the comune of Palermo. As you can see, it is surrounded by other monasteries. 

	An easier way to see how the 4 groups cluster are concentrated across Sicily is by building Chloropleth maps. 
 
	The light olive green means that the highest concentration of monasteries are dedicated to The Virgin Mary. As you can see, that is most of Sicily. The red represents null values and the blue and dark green represent areas where monasteries are dedicated to the holy dedications (those not dedicated to saints but instead to theological concepts). Next we can see the distribution of the 4 groups at the commune level. 

At the commune level:
 
Blue represents null values (no data present). It is better to represent the distribution of the 4 groups by using a chloropleth map at the province level than commune level.

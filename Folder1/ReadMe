#Norman Sicily Orders
This next map is just the distributions of monasteries based on their order. Whatâ€™s interesting about this visualization is way a lot of the Basilian order monasteries cluster around the coast lines (with a few exceptions). This will be explored more in future visualizations. 

Finally, we have a heat map indicating which areas have the highest amount of monasteries depending on their order.

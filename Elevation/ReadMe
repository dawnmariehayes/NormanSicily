#Norman Sicily Digital Elevation    

Elevation was collected using Earth Explorer raster datasets. They were then converted into tif images. Since they are not vector datasets, they can not be converted into geojson files. Tif imagery is for raster datasets (which is what elevation is in terms of spatial analysis).

Currently, the elevation data are used to determine where monasteries are located in reference to their elevations. Elevation is important when taking into account the sustainability of the monasteries. Given that they are eleventh- and twelfth-century structures, they can be easily affected by weathering and erosional effects. Monasteries are ingrained in Italian culture. Understanding erosional effects can enable state and local authorities to better preserve these monuments.

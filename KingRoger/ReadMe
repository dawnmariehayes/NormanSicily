King Roger II was an exceptionally important figure during Sicily's Norman period. Roger was the chief architect of Sicily's political ascent and ruled the island when it was at the height of its power. Therefore, it is important to make distinctions in the monasteries according to their chronologies. Monasteries were separated based on whether they were pre-King Roger, King Roger or post King Roger.

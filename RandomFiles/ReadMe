This folder contains KML's converted into GeoJSON files of the three provinces of Norman Sicily. 
The three KML's were built by georeferencing an image of the three provinces onto current Sicily, using Google Earth Pro.
I converted the KML files in QGIS to GeoJSON to make it simpler to access. The first three GeoJSON files are one of Sicily as a whole with 2 division lines. The second set takes apart Sicily as three separate pieces. This was done for Jamila to use in her work.

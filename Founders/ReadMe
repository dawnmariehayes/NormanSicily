Founders data is separated based on which founder is associated with the monasteries
I separated the CSV data to show the different founders of each monastery. You can click on each geojson which will show you the different founders. 
As you can visualize, there are multiple files for different founders as the founders were an extensive list. Each GeoJSON contains monasteries based on specific founders. When clicking on a GeoJSON, the monasteries based on specific founders will pop up. Some founders are area specific.

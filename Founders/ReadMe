Founders data is separated based on which founder is associated with the monasteries
I separated the CSV data to show the different founders of each monastery. You can click on each geojson which will show you the different founders. 
As you can visualize, there are multiple files for different founders as the founders were an extensive list. Each GeoJSON contains monasteries based on specific founders. When clicking on a GeoJSON, the monasteries based on specific founders will pop up. Some founders are area specific. 

King Roger II was also a founder for the Norman Sicily monasteries. King Roger II rose to power after the death of his brother. King Roger II's power was felt by other countries. The Pope considered to order a crusade due to the power Roger II gained during his rule. Within his rule, Sicily reached the peak of it's power. Keep in mind, during 11th century Norman Sicily, Christianity was prominant. Christianity was powerful in this era. Showing the founders of monasteries can give an indication to the power of the founder. What is interesting about this founder list is the mix of men and women who were founders. Keep in mind, during this time, women did not hold the same amount of power which men held. Exploring more the women who were founders would be an interesting take to move forward with the geneology work.

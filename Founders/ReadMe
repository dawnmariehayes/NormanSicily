Founders data are separated based on which founder is associated with the monasteries.
I separated the CSV data to show the different founders of each monastery. You can click on each geojson which will show you the different founders. 
As you can visualize, there are multiple files for different founders as they made up an extensive list. Each GeoJSON contains monasteries based on specific founders. When clicking on a GeoJSON, the monasteries based on specific founders will pop up. Some founders are area specific. 

King Roger II was also a founder of Norman Sicily's monasteries. He rose to power after the death of his brother. King Roger II's power was felt in many regions. The Pope considered launching a crusade due to the power Roger II gained during his rule. During his reign, Sicily reached the peak of it's power. Keep in mind that in 11th-century Norman Sicily, Christianity was prominant. Christianity was powerful in this era. Showing the founders of monasteries can give an indication of the power of the founder as well as of the monastery. What is interesting about this founder list is the mix of men and women who were founders. Keep in mind, during this time, women did not hold the same amount of power which men held. Exploring the women who were founders would be an interesting take to move forward with the geneology work.

This map encompasses monasteries based on historical province. Using each part of the dataset to build maps, this part of the dataset uses historical provinces to differentiate monasteries. 

Using the dataset, I separated the monasteries based on historical provinces. There are three historical provinces which exist in Norman Sicily. These historical provinces act as locations for where the monastery lies. Sicily was divided into three historical provinces. Any question mark monasteries were also separted to see if they lie within the region.
